I began exploring robotics in the early 2000s, at a time when finding components and tutorials in India was a challenge. Most of what I learned came from experimentation, online communities, and repurposed parts. 
The original free webserver took down the site. More than two decades later, I have rebuilt and modernized the website.


The purpose of this site was to share practical BEAM robotics knowledge using locally available materials—something that was hard to find when I started. 
Over the years, many hobbyists had reached out looking for guidance, and reviving this website felt like the right way to preserve those early learnings while keeping them accessible to anyone interested today.
Hopefully, it will inspire my to restart the hobby.
