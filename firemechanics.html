            <!-- MAIN BODY STRUCTURE -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Main body structure</h3>
            <p>The robot is built around a sturdy aluminium frame. The primary components are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aluminium chassis</li>
                <li>Cast-steel motor clamps</li>
                <li>High-torque motors</li>
                <li>Custom-machined nylon wheels</li>
                <li>Battery bay</li>
                <li>Sensor bay</li>
                <li>Mounting points for circuit boards</li>
                <li>A dedicated mount for a surveillance camera</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- FRAME -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Frame</h3>
            <p>
                The frame turned out to be the trickiest part of the entire build. It’s made from two long aluminium
                bars—the same type used for sliding windows and doors. Holes were drilled along them to mount the motors,
                sensors, and electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two aluminium rods are each 75 cm long, placed 5 cm apart, and connected through the motor clamp.
                The frame is divided into three functional sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Front: camera head and obstacle sensors</li>
                <li>Middle: motor clamps and circuit board stack</li>
                <li>Rear: battery bay and support wheel</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- BATTERY BAY -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Battery bay</h3>
            <p>
                The robot uses two 6V, 4.5Ah sealed lead-acid batteries. Since they sit at the rear of the frame,
                a universal support wheel was added to reduce friction and prevent the tail from dragging.
                The support wheel was sourced from a refrigerator spare-parts shop.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                The battery tray is a simple rectangular metal plate with holes drilled for bolts and the support wheel.

            <!-- MOTOR & CLAMP -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Motor &amp; clamp</h3>
            <p>
                FIRE runs on two INRAD 12V tri-speed wiper motors—one for each wheel. They offer speeds of 25, 35, and
                45 rpm, and were purchased from a local automobile market.
            </p>

            <p>
                The motor must have enough torque to carry the weight of the robot and any payload, if necessary. I
                measured the torque to be about 60 kg·cm. In this robot, the motors are operated at 25 rpm to reduce the
                current drawn. The peak current drawn is 4 A under full load.
            </p>

            <p>Torque = Force × perpendicular distance</p>

            <p>
                To estimate the torque, we attached a 10 cm steel rod to the motor shaft. We then added weights at the end
                of the rod until the motor could no longer complete continuous 360-degree rotations. At that point, the
                motor was unable to lift a load of about 6 kg.
            </p>

            <p>Torque = 6 × 10 kg·cm = 60 kg·cm</p>

            <p>
                After the robot was assembled it could lift about 7 kg. I ran out of extra weights to test with. My guess
                is that it can easily carry another 5 kg. The robot itself weighs 6 kg and, in addition to that, I
                estimate it can carry an additional 13 kg.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>(INRAD 12 V, tri-speed wiper motors)</p>

            <p>
                One challenge was that when mounted vertically, the two motor bodies don’t sit in the same plane, causing
                a slight imbalance. To compensate, a custom clamp with a tilt in the holding area was designed. It works
                well enough, though a cleaner solution would be to replace the internal gears with custom ones.
            </p>

            <!-- WHEELS -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Wheels</h3>
            <p>
                My initial idea for the wheels was to use chain sprockets from motor bikes. However, they were too heavy
                and the teeth were dangerous. I decided instead to make custom nylon wheels for the robot. These turned
                out to be the most expensive part of the build. I spent Rs. 600 for 2.5 kg of nylon cylinder stock and then
                took it to a lathe to machine the wheels to the required dimensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The diameter of each wheel is 150 mm and the width is 10 mm. The wheel includes a provision to attach the
                motor shaft using Allen screws. The diameter of the wheel plays a major role in determining the speed of
                the robot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="images/FIRE/Mechanics/FIRE11.JPG" alt="Nylon wheels" width="491" height="243" border="0"/>
            </p>
            <p>(Nylon wheels)</p>

            <p>
                To achieve a speed of 20 cm/min, the wheel radius was calculated based on the motor’s rotational speed.
                The motor runs at 25 rpm, so substituting into the linear velocity formula:
            </p>

            <p>Linear velocity = angular velocity × circumference</p>
            <p>20 = 25 × 2 × π × R</p>
            <p>Solving for R, R = 20 / (25 × 2 × π)</p>
            <p>This gives a wheel radius of approximately 7.5 cm.</p>

            <!-- CIRCUIT BOARD MOUNTS -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Circuit board mounts</h3>
            <p>
                The circuit boards are stacked one above the other in the middle part of the robot using long 8&quot; bolts.
            </p>

            <!-- SURVEILLANCE CAMERA MOUNT -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">Surveillance camera mount</h3>
            <p>
                The camera head is mounted on the front part of the robot on the aluminium frame, giving it a full view
                of the surroundings.
            </p>

            <!-- IR SENSOR BAY -->
            <h3 class="section-heading">IR sensor bay</h3>
            <p>
                The IR sensors are mounted on small aluminium brackets at the front part of the frame. The bolts allow
                the sensors to maintain a low clearance so they can easily detect edges.
            </p>
